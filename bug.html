<p>This is a common HTML error.  It occurs when you use a tag incorrectly.  Here is an example:</p><code><div><p>This is some text</p></div></code><p>This HTML is valid, but it is not semantically correct. The <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tag is a generic container element, while the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag is a paragraph element.  It is generally better to use a <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag only for paragraphs and use <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tags only for structural purposes, rather than just grouping content together.</p><p>Another example of an uncommon error is a malformed tag:</p><code><div>This is some text<div></code><p>In this case the opening and closing div tags do not match. This can lead to unexpected display issues.</p>
