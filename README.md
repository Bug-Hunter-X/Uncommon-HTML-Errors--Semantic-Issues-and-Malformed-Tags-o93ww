# Uncommon HTML Errors

This repository demonstrates some uncommon errors that can occur in HTML code.  These examples focus on semantic issues and malformed tags, which are often overlooked but can lead to rendering problems or accessibility issues.

## Bug 1: Semantically Incorrect Nesting

The first example shows incorrect nesting of elements. While syntactically correct, it doesn't follow best practices and semantic HTML.  This is a subtlety that often escapes notice.

## Bug 2: Malformed Tags

The second example shows a malformed tag, where the opening and closing tags don't match.  This is a classic error that can be tricky to debug, especially in larger projects.

## Solutions

The `bugSolution.html` file provides corrected versions of the HTML in `bug.html`, addressing the semantic and structural issues.  The solutions prioritize semantic correctness and well-formed HTML.
